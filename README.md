# Graphic-Attractor
Just generates pretty attractor patterns in OpenGL using GLUT. 'main.cpp' renders a Lorenz attractor which can be rotated in a 3D space, and 'main2.cpp' generates a 2D CLifford attractor

*note: all the sources files are run inside a docker container with image from nvidia/opengl*
